## Instructions

This project has the scope of converting a static web page in a single interactive page.

It uses javascript to dynamically create a navigation bar menu links based on the content, when a section is active its color is changed to red to be distinguished from the rest of the page. Also its link color in the navigation bar menu changes from grey to white & becomes bold to give a feeling that it is lightened on.

The navigation bar becomes hidden upon scrolling the page down & reappears upon mouse leaving of the window

There is a link on the middle of the navigation bar (page top) can move you to the top of the page upon click
